# landing-page
This is my attempt at the second project from The Odin Project. I'm creating a landing page that utilizes both HTML and CSS, as well as Flexbox while it's fresh on my mind. (I'm totally struggling.) :')

With this project, I am demonstrating these skills:
- Setting up a webpage with HTML
- Sprucing elements up with CSS
- Aligning and sizing elements with Flexbox
- Googling stuff I'm not familiar with
